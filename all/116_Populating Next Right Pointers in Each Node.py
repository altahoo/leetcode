# 116. Populating Next Right Pointers in Each Node

# You are given a perfect binary tree where all leaves are on the same level, and every parent has two children. The binary tree has the following definition:

# struct Node {
#   int val;
#   Node *left;
#   Node *right;
#   Node *next;
# }
# Populate each next pointer to point to its next right node. If there is no next right node, the next pointer should be set to NULL.

# Initially, all next pointers are set to NULL.
